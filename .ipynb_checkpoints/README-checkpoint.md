## Mapping 2D **SPARC** data points to a 3D scaffold: a tutorial
The object of this tutorial is to introduce some of the features of the **SPARC** project in an interactive manner. The goal will be to retrieve 2D **SPARC** datasets of neurons in the stomach and project them onto a 3D scaffold of the organ.
