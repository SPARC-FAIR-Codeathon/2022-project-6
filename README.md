### **About**
The **S**timulating **P**eripheral **A**ctivity to **R**elieve **C**onditions ([**SPARC**](https://sparc.science/about)) program is supported by the NIH Common Fund to provide a scientific and technological foundation for future bioelectronic medicine devices and protocols. The initiative is made up of over ***60*** research teams scattered around the globe, all working together on a common objective. The entire project is **Open Source** and follows the **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable ([**FAIR**](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)) guidelines for data management.

In 2021, the amazing team of the **D**ata and **R**esource **C**enter ([**DRC**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34248680/)) organised a [**Codeathon**](https://sparc.science/help/2021-sparc-fair-codeathon) to improve various elements of the **SPARC** program. This year, they've done it [again](https://sparc.science/help/2022-sparc-fair-codeathon)!

### **Dependencies**
List of packages that are used in this tutorial
   * package one, version x
   * package 2, version x

### **Getting started**
If you have not already done so, clone the GitHub repository onto your local machine into the _SPARC-tutorial_ folder wit the following command:

    $ git clone git@github.com:SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/SPARC-Tutorial.git SPARC-tutorial

The tutorial is contained in a Jupyter Notebook and requires Jupyter Lab to run. 
If you are unsure if Jupyter Lab is installed on your machine use this command in a terminal:

    $ which jupyter-lab
    
If there is no output, [install](https://jupyter.org/install) Jupyter Lab with the following command:
    
    $ pip install jupyterlab
    
Once this is done or if you already have Jupyter Lab installed on your machine simply navigate into the cloned directory and run Jupyter Lab:

    $ cd SPARC-tutorial && jupyter-lab

From your browser, you can then open the notebook by clicking on ***SPARC-tutorial.ipynb*** and follow the tutorial from there.
