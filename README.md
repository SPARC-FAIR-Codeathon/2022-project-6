### **About**
Brief description of the SPARC project. Explain that the tutorial is fully functionnal in the Jupyter Notebook. The object of this tutorial is to introduce some of the features of the **SPARC** project in an interactive manner. The goal will be to retrieve 2D **SPARC** datasets of neurons in the stomach and project them onto a 3D scaffold of the organ.  


### **Dependencies**
List of packages that are used in this tutorial
   * package one, version x
   * package 2, version x

### **Getting started**
If you have not already done so, clone the GitHub repository onto your local machine into the _SPARC-tutorial_ folder wit the following command:

    $ git clone git@github.com:SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/SPARC-Tutorial.git SPARC-tutorial

The tutorial is contained in a Jupyter Notebook and requires Jupyter Lab to run. 
If you are unsure if Jupyter Lab is installed on your machine use this command in a terminal:

    $ which jupyter-lab
    
If there is no output, [install](https://jupyter.org/install) Jupyter Lab with the following command:
    
    $ pip install jupyterlab
    
Once this is done or if you already have Jupyter Lab installed on your machine simply navigate into the cloned directory and run Jupyter Lab:

    $ cd SPARC-tutorial && jupyter-lab

From your browser, you can then open the notebook by clicking on ***SPARC-tutorial.ipynb*** and follow the tutorial from there.
