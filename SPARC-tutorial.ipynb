    "Welcome! In this tutorial, we will be demonstrating different features from the [**SPARC**](https://sparc.science/) project. The goal will be to project the 2D locations of neurites in the rat stomach onto a 3D scaffhold of the organ. The data points and the 3D scaffhold will be pulled from **SPARC** datasets. Because the data is [**FAIR**](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) we will be combining three different datasets of the spatial distribution of the vagal afferents and efferents. \n"

If you haven't used the links above, you can click on the purple ***Get Dataset*** button on the left side of the screen or directly in the ***Files*** tab. You will then be prompted to save the archive. Save each one in the _SPARC-tutorial_ folder. "
